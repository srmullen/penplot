Intersection Aggregate
----------------------

A surface filled with 100 medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate.
Display:
A - The instantaneous intersections of the circles.
B - The aggregate intersections of the circles.

Notes
-----
- Going to try using a KD Tree here. Should write about its implementation.
